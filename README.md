The Sage special functions package
==========================

### Introduction

This is a package for special function for the SAGE software package. The main
idea of this package is to fill the gap in SAGE for support of special 
functions. It should support both nummeric and symbolic calulations with 
special functions. The current aim is to support both basic special functions
and their $q$-analogues.

### Things to be done

Simple answer: a lot.
The module is still in development and there are a lot of things to do.
The aim is to first concentrate on the following (simple) implementation,
preferably in this order:

+ Pochhammer Symbols
+ Hypergeometric Series
+ $q$-Pochhammer Symbols
+ Basic Hypergeometric Series
+ Orthogonal Polynomials
+ Matrix-valued Orthogonal Polynomials

### Participate

Yes, please! There are a lot of things that can be done right now. If you
